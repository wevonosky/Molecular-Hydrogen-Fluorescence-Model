# Molecular-Hydrogen-Fluorescence-Model
Model of molecular hydrogen emission originating from the stellar photosphere and pumped by lyman alpha radiation originating in the chromosphere

## Parameters
The model varies the molecular hydrogen column density and temperature and the atomic hydrogens column density (in the chromosphere).

## Model Explanation
The model geometry assumes that some lyman profile is generated in the chromosphere, is attenauated by atomic hydrogen, and then
is absorbed and reemitted on the photsphere by the molecular hydrogen. 

## Contributors
Major contributions to this code were provided by Kevin France, Matt Mcjunkin, and Allison Youngblood (https://github.com/allisony). 
My contribution was mainly compiling all the code and re-purposing the model for the task at hand.
